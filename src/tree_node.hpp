 * Description:      This file declares the abstract class `TreeNode` for use
 *                   in Dirichlet Trees. A node in a Dirichlet Tree represents
 *                   a non-terminal state in an incomplete stochastic process.
 *                   For example, a node might represent an IRV ballot that is
 *                   not yet completely specified.
 *
 *                   A TreeNode should provide an interface to its' parent
 *                   (or the `DirichletTree` class if it is the root) which
 *                   allows for sampling count data from the sub-tree, updating
 *                   interior Dirichlet parameters, and sampling leaf-
 *                   probabilities of specific outcomes.

   * leaf) will realize a complete IRV ballot.

   *  sampling step, sacrificing precision for numerical efficiency.

   * underlying stochastic process possible from the starting point
   * that this node represents.
